# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has afforded us with the opportunity to complete the following tasks to assist with the election audit of a recent local congressional election. This election audit, and election audits in general, are important because they allow us to fact check one of the key pieces of a democracy, voting in elections. The purpose of this audit is to synthesize the data we were given concerning a recent election into an easily consumable txt file containing a brief report on our findings from the tasks assigned to us.

The election audit consists of the tasks below:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
